# Week 11 answers

## Exercise 1
1. The message the customer never saw: The system instructions ("You are Sunny. Answer in one short sentence.")
2. How many times the customer has spoken: 2 times
3. Can the model tell that the last reply came from the order tool? Why does that matter?: No, the model only sees it as a standard assistant role message. It cannot tell code executed it, meaning it treats past tool outputs just like AI-generated text.
4. The customer now types "thanks". How many messages are sent on the next call?: 6 messages (the system instruction, the 4 existing history messages, plus the new user message).
